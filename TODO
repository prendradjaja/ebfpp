- passes automated tests

JS compiler:
x add tests for "demo"
_ structured into modules
x has acceptable documentation

Readme:
x bff4
_ how to run
_ how to compile parser
_ how to install fs and underscore
_ linter
_ directory structure
_ aliases
_ example code

x Makefile exists, with rules for:
_ tests

Other documentation:
_ properly attribute EVERYTHING
