### Configuration settings.

allow_bare_comments = True
# True: the compiler will ignore anything that isn't legal EBF. As a result,
#     you can type essentially any text and it will automatically become a
#     comment. This makes it a little easier to make mistakes, but is more
#     true to the original EBF compiler.
# False: the compiler will only allow comments marked with a semicolon.
