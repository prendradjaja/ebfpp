; This is an example of using arrays and structs, using a static (index is a
; number, and therefore known at compile time) array access.

; define struct type called 'Pair' with two members, 'first' and 'second'
:=Pair {first second}

; define and initialize an array of Pairs
::list Pair           {65 97 / 66 98 / 67 99}
; these are ascii for   A  a    B  b    C  c
#
; access array index 1
$:list 1

; and then access the members in that struct. Note that we know which struct
; we're accessing based on the most recent array access.
$$first .
$$second .
