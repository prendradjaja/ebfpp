; This is an example of using arrays and structs, using a dynamic (index is a
; variable, and therefore unknown at compile time) array access.

:=Pair {first second}
::list Pair           {65 97 / 66 98 / 67 99}
; these are ascii for   A  a    B  b    C  c

; set i to 1
:i
$i +

; access array index i
$!list i

$$first .
$$second .
